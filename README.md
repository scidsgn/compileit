CompileIt
===

CompileIt is an experimental AutoIt-to-machine code compiler.

Usage
---
CompileIt's UI is pretty straightforward - select a file and press "Compile".

Make sure that you have [GCC]() installed and CompileIt is configured to work with it.

Limitations
---
CompileIt covers only a small subset of AutoIt. See SUPPORTED.html for a list of supported syntax and language elements.
